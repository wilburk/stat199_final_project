### Load Packages & Data

```{r load-packages-data}
library(stringr)
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)

# run load-data.csv first
food <- read_csv("data/food.csv")
food_small <- read_csv("data/food-small.csv")
```

### EDA 

```{r}

# ratings by alcohol & good for kids
food %>% 
  filter(!is.na(attributes.Alcohol), !is.na(attributes.GoodForKids)) %>% 
  group_by(attributes.GoodForKids, attributes.Alcohol) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(stars),
            n = n())

# get top # cities
food_small %>% 
  count(city) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))

# filter for toronto, non null neighborhoods
toronto_neighborhood <- food_small %>% 
  filter(city == "Toronto", neighborhood != "")

# look at top neighborhoods
toronto_neighborhood %>%
  count(neighborhood) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))

# aggregate postal codes (heirarchical structure so just took two few numbers)
toronto_neighborhood <- toronto_neighborhood %>%
  mutate(postal_code_short = substr(postal_code, 1 , 2))

# summary stats by neighborhood
toronto_neighborhood %>% 
  group_by(neighborhood) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(stars), n = n()) %>% 
  filter(n > 10) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean))

# kmeans by attributes 7 through 10
kmns <- kmeans(toronto_neighborhood[7:10], 10)

# view kmeans results
head(augment(kmns, toronto_neighborhood))
tidy(kmns)

# view postal codes in space
ggplot(toronto_neighborhood, aes(x = latitude, y = longitude, color = postal_code_short)) +
  geom_point()
```
### kmeans

```{r}
# kmeans exploratory analysis
kmns <- data.frame(k=1:9) %>% 
  group_by(k) %>% 
  do(kmns=kmeans(toronto_neighborhood[7:8], .$k))

clusters <- kmns %>%
    group_by(k) %>%
    do(tidy(.$kmns[[1]]))

assignments <- kmns %>%
    group_by(k) %>%
    do(augment(.$kmns[[1]], toronto_neighborhood))

clusterings <- kmns %>%
    group_by(k) %>%
    do(glance(.$kmns[[1]]))

p1 <- ggplot(assignments, aes(latitude, longitude)) +
    geom_point(aes(color=.cluster)) +
    facet_wrap(~ k)

p1
